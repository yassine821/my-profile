<h2>
     Hi , my name is yassine , i am a 19 years old and i study management at emlv in Paris , France . I grew up in north Morocco as an only child to my parents . After graduating in high school ,  i moved here to france searching for a good university to begin and finish my career , then i found Pole de Leonard de Vinci where i'm studing now . 
    When i was growing up , i would watch football with my grandfather every week ,  and he was the one who helped me learn how to play it in the first place , that's how football became my passion and my hobby . Other than football , i love natation , i think that's because i grew up in a city where there is so many beaches and i would go to swim all the time either with my friends or my family.
    My goal in the future is to become an accountant , accounting has been my best class in the last 3 years , and i'ts one of the best reasons that keeps me in this field of studies.
